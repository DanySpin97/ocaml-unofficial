# What ?
This is an *unofficial* repository for OCaml packages in Exherbo.

# Why ?
Because of the need to centralize OCaml-related packages that are of general
interest and fight against bit-rot.

# Who ?
Nicolas Braud-Santoni (*nicoo* on `freenode/#exherbo`).  
More to come, hopefully.

# On silly licencing issues
Inclusion in Exherbo's tree requires GPLv2.

As such, all files here are licensed under GPLv2, as mentionned in the headers.
